# RSA-Encryption

RSA is an algorithm used by modern computers to encrypt and decrypt messages. It is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm. Asymmetric means that there are two different keys. This is also called public key cryptography, because one of the keys can be given to anyone. The other key must be kept private. The algorithm is based on the fact that finding the factors of a large composite number is difficult: when the integers are prime numbers, the problem is called prime factorization.

## Status - Completed Partially
The project was implemented on Arduino where a special math library was used in order to calculate power of very large number which even unsigned long long can not store.
